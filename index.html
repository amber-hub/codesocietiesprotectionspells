        <p> <b>invisibility</b> spells (incognito mode). <b>muting</b> spells (like on google home). <b>deletion</b> spells (to clear cookies and passwords and remove data). <b>ad blocker</b> spells (so that we can choose to consent to consumption)</p>

    <div class="spells" id="abolition">

      <p>A ritual technology an <span id="abolitionist"> abolitionist </span> witchware: design a mask that calls forth images of your <span id="ancestors"> ancestors </span> and abstracts them over your face when it detects attempted facial recognition. When the Market/State via the Machine attempts to see you, place you, hold you all it finds is the righteous fury of those who dreamed you into existence, those who you existed within as a possibility, those who live within you along with futures you can't yet see but are neccesarily a part of.</p>

        <p><em> anti surveillance silver woven shroud</em> that blocks incoming communication signals and doesn't register body heat - christina </p>

    </div>

    <div class="spells" id="tape">

      <p> can a spell be as simple as a piece of tape over the webcam? i think that in this space we have concantenated (i don't know if i used that word right and there's no spell-check when youre writing code) but anyway i think we have concantenated something even more powerful: a network of community care and solidarity. as char jer&eacute put it one class -- talking to your neighbors is a kind of magic. we have shared so many connections contra the unsavory wills of the powers that be. creating ritual: perhaps we start a signal group chat? staying connected is the medicine. </p>


    </div>

    <div class="spells" id="tiger">
      <p><b>Use a tigers eye stone as a interferance, or more like a natural VPN. It can emit energy that is held inside to mask, veil, disrupt, reroute the surveillance systems that be all up in our business and stay trying to control us.<span id="bump"> Bump that shit.</span></b></p></div>

    </div>

    <div class="spells" id="emf">
      <p>EMFs are terrifying. One week in November I got really ill, and spent the whole week in bed reading about EMFs. We need to think of methods to protect our <span id="bodies"> bodies.</span> We need to spend time forest-bathing, as the Japanese would say. We need to learn to have a <span id=healthy> healthy</span> relationship with technology - and that will vary depending on the person, where they live, where they <span id="work"> work</span>, their circumstance. We need to learn to use technology and not let it use us. It is a <span id="tool"> tool</span> just like a kitchen utensil. Mental health will be on the rise as it is, and until we dont create rituals to take breaks from technology, it will get worse. This probably sounds all very conservative and old-fashioned, but <span id="obladi"> ob la di.</span></p>

    <div class="spells" id="skincare">
      <p><b>The kinds of spells we need to protect us are TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PEOPLE. We need tools that are de-centralized that the government or evil third parties can't hack into. We need something open and accessible for all, and maybe spread via word of mouth. We need a computer that is built with Good in mind, and has data scrambling built in. We need something to make us feel safe, even if it is is a personal chant or mantra. What if it were voice-activated? We need skincare that adds a shiny layer to our face when photos are taken so that we are unrecognizeable unless we review the photos, and give consent (maybe through an app).</b></p>

    <div class="spells" id="writing">
      <p><em>i want a return to handwritten notes, or material communication that can be repurposed...writing words on paper that can be <span id="planted"> burned, digested, planted.</span></em></p>

    <div class="spells" id="vpn">
      <p>i want my friends to be safer than they are. i want the people i love to be safer than they are. i want to take the logic of the vpn or proxy server and use it to embrace everyone i know. i want my friends to be safer than they are. i want to weave a giant vpn of all our dreams and deepest loves and most nostalgic memories and use it to coast around the internet securely and with joy.</p>

    <div class="spells" id="politics">
      <p>creating a list of specific surveillance technologies and how they are harmful &amp; then calling up lawmakers and voicing my concerns.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="spells" id="herd">
      <p>I like the concept of herd immunity alot. Perhaps a spell we can implement is whatever we learn is easily transferable to our immediate community. A way to disemminate things in secret, <b>like a whisper.</b></p>

      <p><em>Grounding stones, a small altar or a tiny object that you keep by your side to help the body stay connected back to earth. ‚ù§Ô∏è -Lina </em></p>

    </div>

    <div class="spells" id="letgo">
      <p>One of my favorite protective rituals, protective in that it <em>cleanses</em>, it <em>renews</em>: make a list of all that you want to let go of, <em>take your time</em>. Go outdoors (perhaps with someone you trust), with matches, or a lighter. Burn the list. Observe the smoke, the smell it creates. Imagine the words are the smoke and the smoke is the words. See it dissipate into the air. <em>Breathe deep</em>.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="spells" id="organize">
      <p>disconnect our devices at night, organize against intrusive data collection.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="spells" id="fluct">
      <p>
One thing I just thought about was the mantra fluct guided us though during their workshop "I will not hurt you, I will not hurt myself, I will not others/ we will not hurt others" and thinking about<div><br>1) What it would mean to like make that my password for logging into my computer so that i'm always having this meditation when I begin to use it.</div><div> <br>2) My computer and mobile device saying this to each other in some way</div><div><br>3) How difficult this with my technology as agents because they are necessarily attached to so mach harm. In the minerals extracted to build them or in the various agents invested in using my technology as a site to extract value from me, so maybe</div><div><br>4) that mantra or agreement would have to take place in multiple places, at multiple points before the computer as technology even exists as a "single object" I interact with</div><br>

    <div class="spells" id="energy">
      <p><b><em>a protective spell to be able to connect with all of the people who have given you positive energy no matter how short the duration was. this magic spell will have the ability for the person to harness a space of love and understanding, preventing any negativity, hate, and violence from reaching this space.</em></b></p>

    <div class="spells" id="eye">
      <p>what scares me about technology is the hidden underbelly of surveillance. i‚Äôve heard of fake ATM machines that can ‚Äúcopy‚Äù your card and PIN number when you use it. I worry about the same kind of third party monitoring on my own computer<br><div>i wish there was some type of divinatory software that was protective of the software owner (like a Third Eye??). I could invoke the Third Eye whenever I log on by typing in a personal password, and it would alert me whenever my camera was being used, my keyboard strokes were being watched, my clicks were being tracked. Maybe not just an alert, but an automatic veiling of my actions, too</div></br><br>tina</br>
